				//Say you add two ideas 1.1.3 and 1.1.4, but then decide to delete idea 1.1.3.  Now, the idea "1.1.4" is the third idea in the array and exists at index 2.  When the client interacts with idea 1.1.4 on the interface, the program will try to call idea 1.1.4 as the fourth idea in the array that exists at index 3, and will state that the idea is "undefined".
